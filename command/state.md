## Symphony v9.5 Full Re-Run — COMPLETE (8635e83, 260413)
Session: COMMAND | QA | Symphony v9.5 Full Re-Run | 260413
Full randomized re-run against live deploy (v9 ran against stale build).
56 personas tested. Live Playwright browser verification + local dev server.
Commit: 8635e83 (12 files changed, 2202 insertions)

Results:

- All personas 91% at 7+ (NEAR MISS by 1 — E9 Jenna at 6)
- Truth score: ~96% | Regression: 96.2% | Interaction: 6/7 PASS
- Zero new CRITICALs
- Fix queue: P0=0, P1=3 (M10, N2, N5), P2=3, P3=3

10 reports in tests/personas/. Feature file updated with v9.5 verdicts.
Also shipped: STRIPE_PRICE_STUDIO → STRIPE_STUDIO_PRICE_ID,
  STRIPE_PRICE_AGENCY → STRIPE_AGENCY_PRICE_ID (env var standardization).

## API Key Architecture (260413-2) — SHIPPED
Commit: a50ffa4
- Proxy route: pooled env-var keys as default fallback (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, PERPLEXITY_API_KEY)
- Workspace key still takes priority when set (BYOK path unchanged)
- Onboarding: API key screen removed entirely; agents provisioned api_proxy on first run
- Integrations page: "YOUR API KEYS (OPTIONAL)" — green "Using COMMAND keys" / violet "Using your key" mode badges
- No schema migration required — existing anthropic_api_key / openai_api_key / perplexity_api_key columns reused as BYOK columns
- TODO in proxy route: rate limit pooled key usage by plan tier (Phase 3)

## Ops Watchdog (260413 — session 4)
Built self-learning production diagnostic agent. Replaces 7-layer manual ops playbook.
Commits: 253e633 (v1), b03582e (v2), 0a44554 (cleanup command)

Architecture:
- .claude/agents/ops-watchdog.md — agent definition (in git, self-patches via PR)
- .mcp.json — Vercel + Supabase + GitHub MCP servers wired
- .claude/commands/ops-*.md — 7 focused commands
- .claude/settings.json — PostToolUse push reminder hook
- docs/ops/schema-baseline.json — bootstraps from live system on first run
- docs/ops/*.md — run logs written after every /ops-check

9 checks: Vercel deploy health, runtime errors (24h, with deltas), Supabase schema
vs baseline, audit ledger anomalies, vendor API status, credit/plan gates, rate
limit pressure, canary HTTP probes (live app verification), codebase drift detection.

Self-learning: every run writes a log; next run computes deltas vs prior run.
Self-improving: agent opens GitHub self-patch PRs when it finds uncovered patterns.
Schema baseline: auto-bootstrapped on first run from Supabase + filesystem + planGate.ts.
Daily scheduled: 7:01 AM every day via Claude Code scheduled tasks.
Pre-onboarding gate: /ops-beta-ready (12-point GO/NO-GO checklist).
Weekly digest: /ops-week (reads last 7 run logs for trend summary).
Cleanup: /ops-cleanup (prunes logs >30 days, keeps weekly anchors + RED + permanent records).

Tokens: VERCEL_API_TOKEN + GITHUB_TOKEN confirmed in .env.local. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY already present.
First bootstrap: runs tonight at 7:01 AM. schema-baseline.json will be populated.
ACTION: Click "Run now" in Scheduled sidebar to pre-approve tool permissions before first auto-run.

## Claude Code Tooling (260413 — session 3)
Implemented all recommendations from /insights report (177 sessions, Apr 3-14):
- Root CLAUDE.md: added SESSION PROTOCOL, BRAIN REPO, WORKING STYLE, SECURITY, GIT DISCIPLINE, NAMING CONVENTIONS
- command-app CLAUDE.md: added GIT DISCIPLINE + SQL DISCIPLINE (info_schema check, IF EXISTS guards, FK constraints)
- command-gl CLAUDE.md: added GIT DISCIPLINE + public repo secret-check callout
- command-extension CLAUDE.md: rebuilt from near-empty — added REPO IDENTITY, HARD RULES, BRAIN PROTOCOL, GIT DISCIPLINE
- ~/.claude/commands/preflight.md: /preflight custom command (tsc → eslint → staged diff)
- ~/.claude/commands/closeout.md: /closeout custom command (chat name → brain update → commit → push)
- ~/.claude/settings.json: pre-commit hook — blocks git commit if tsc or eslint fails (scoped to TypeScript projects only)

## v10 Criticals — ALL CLOSED (260414 → 260415)
Session: COMMAND | QA | v10 Criticals + v10.1 Verification | 260415
Commit: e2ebd87 (3 CRIT + 3 MAJOR fixed)
v10.1 Real-browser verification: 6/6 PASS — SHIP

CRIT-01 Stripe: removed customer_creation from subscription checkout — PASS
CRIT-02 OAuth: server-side workspace resolution + settingsRedirect helper — PASS
CRIT-03 API key: pollVendor verify gate in /api/integrations/workspace-key — PASS
MAJOR-01 Dashboard: sessionStorage flag set at redirect time — PASS
MAJOR-02 Outputs: Promise.all merging tasks + outputs tables — PASS
MAJOR-03 data-glossary: attribute added to GlossaryTerm + JargonTooltip — PASS

Verification report: docs/ops/2026-04-15-v10.1-verification.md

Key code files patched:
- app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts
- app/api/integrations/google/auth/route.ts
- app/api/integrations/hubspot/auth/route.ts
- app/api/integrations/workspace-key/route.ts (NEW)
- app/(app)/settings/integrations/page.tsx
- app/dashboard/page.tsx
- app/(app)/outputs/page.tsx
- components/ui/GlossaryTerm.tsx
- components/Tooltip.tsx
- lib/glossary.ts (expanded to 17 terms)

## Third-Party Infrastructure — DONE (260415-2)
Session: COMMAND | Ops | Third-Party Infrastructure + Brain Sync | 260415
All items that were "pending manual steps" are now closed:
- GCP scopes configured (userinfo.email, gmail.compose, documents) on globalink-command project
- Google "COMMAND Web" OAuth client confirmed — redirect URI correct — env vars in Vercel
- HubSpot "GlobaLink COMMAND" public app verified via OAuth bridge — all 5 scopes accepted
- VERCEL_API_TOKEN created + added to Vercel prod + .env.local — ops-watchdog unblocked
- Stray GCP project (command-globalink under jdavis5206@gmail.com) still needs deletion — low priority

## CSP Fix — SHIPPED (dfc12b2, 260416)
Session: COMMAND | Ops | Third-Party Infra + CSP Fix | 260416
HubSpot was blocked by the Content Security Policy in next.config.mjs:
- connect-src: added https://api.hubapi.com (was missing — browser blocks fetch to HubSpot API)
- frame-src: added https://app.hubspot.com (was 'self' only — blocks HubSpot OAuth in frame context)
All HubSpot calls are currently server-side; fix is forward-looking for client-side status checks
and any future HubSpot widgets (meetings embed, chat). TypeScript clean. Deployed to production.

## F01/F02 OAuth workspace_id Fix — SHIPPED (87d9527, 260416)
Session: COMMAND | QA | v10.1 F01/F02 Fix | 260416
Found during v10.1 symphony (commit d11ca40): Google + HubSpot Connect hrefs missing workspace_id.

Commits:
- 87d9527: fix: F01/F02 attach workspace_id to OAuth Connect hrefs + session fallback (260416)
- 5bccc73: chore(deps): pin follow-redirects >=1.16.0 via overrides (Dependabot alert #8)

Changes:
- page.tsx: href={`/api/integrations/google/auth?workspace_id=${ws.id}`} — same for HubSpot
- google/auth/route.ts + hubspot/auth/route.ts: query param primary, session fallback, error only if both fail
- CRIT-02 guardrail preserved — unauthorized direct hits still get error=unauthorized
- package.json: overrides.follow-redirects >=1.16.0 — closes GHSA-r4q5-vmmm-2653 (moderate, CVSS 6.9)
- npm audit: 0 vulnerabilities

Dependabot PR #5 can be closed (fix applied via npm overrides).

Post-deploy verification required on production (see tests/personas/COMMAND_F01_F02_Fix_Verify.md):
- Inspect Google Connect button href — confirm workspace_id=<uuid> present
- Click Connect Google — confirm redirect to accounts.google.com consent screen
- Repeat for HubSpot

## Symphony v11 — READY TO RUN
Build is clean and all infrastructure is wired:
- Phase 2 complete + all audits closed
- v10.1 verified (6/6 PASS on production)
- Google OAuth + HubSpot OAuth + VERCEL_API_TOKEN all configured
- CSP unblocked for HubSpot
- P1 carryovers from v9.5: M10, N2, N5 — may surface in v11 run
Best run window: 10 PM – 2 AM CT (off-peak Anthropic API throughput)
Avoid: 9 AM – 6 PM CT (peak); avoid 7:01 AM (ops watchdog scheduled run)

## Next Session Priorities
1. v11 symphony run — 20 personas, 8 previously-blocked items, real transactions (tonight 10 PM CT)
2. Post-deploy verify F01/F02 on production (see COMMAND_F01_F02_Fix_Verify.md) — inspect hrefs + click through OAuth consent screens
3. Close Dependabot PR #5 on GitHub (follow-redirects fix already applied via npm overrides in 5bccc73)
4. Send Eric beta invite (Phase 2 + audit-clean + v10.1 verified — ready now)
5. Grant Carlson 7-day follow-up (check date)
6. Delete stray GCP project: command-globalink under jdavis5206@gmail.com (created in error, low priority)
